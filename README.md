# Movies Browser App

This repository contains a ReactJS app which is a two-page web app for browsing and searching movies

## Successful Tasks

✔️ State Management using ReduxToolkit

✔️ Implemented design according to attached UI specs using React Components

✔️ Implemented Infinite scrolling

✔️ Routing

✔️ API Integration

✔️ Code structuring

✔️ Performance

✔️ Movie searching using debounce technique

✔️ Responsive design

✔️ Automated unit Testing using Jest and React Testing library

✔️ Error logging for APIs

✔️ PWA

✔️ Installable app with offline request caching

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`REACT_APP_POSTER_URL` ,
`REACT_APP_MOVIE_ACCESSS_TOKEN`

For example, please refer the .env.example file in the root directory

#### Follow these steps:

1. Login to TMDB
2. Get the access token from profile
3. Create a file named ".env" in the root directory of your project
4. Copy the contents of .env.example to .env file and replace <your-access-token> with your access token
5. Save the ".env" file.

Now your application can use TMDb with the access token you provided.

## I'm mostly proud of..

✔️ **Responsive app implemented according to attached UI design**

I believe my ability to implementation of the responsive design to be a strong demonstration of my proficiency.I carefully followed the attached UI design to ensure that the application is mobile responsive.

✔️ **PWA implementation**

Implementation of PWA is a major accomplishment, demonstrating my ability to learn new skills quickly.

✔️ **Searching using debounce technique**

I learned and applied the debounce technique to the search functionality, allowing for more efficient searches.

✔️ **Performance**

I take pride in optimizing application performance, which includes making the app SEO-friendly. This reflects my expertise in ensuring that the application not only functions smoothly but is also discoverable on search engines, enhancing its reach and accessibility.

## Improvements with 4 More Hours

- **Loading and transition animations for smooth UI:** Adding more animations and transitions to pages loading and image loading.

- **Handling of more edge cases of error Handling:** Eventhough error handling is already implemented, more error handling and implementation of a fallback UI would improve the perfomance and functionality.

- **More Unit Test Coverage:** More unit test cases for navigation and redering which would increase the code reliability.

- **Code Splitting:** Improve the asset loading, implement lazy loading for images, and explore additional opportunities for code splitting to minimize initial load time

## Feedback

I found this challenge to be well-structured and comprehensive in assessing React development skills. The provided UI specs and API integration requirements offered a realistic scenario, allowing me to showcase my abilities effectively. One potential improvement could be to include a more detailed scoring rubric for each evaluation criterion, providing candidates with clearer expectations.

Again, thank you for this opportunity. I look forward to discussing my work further and the possibility of joining the GSynergy team.
